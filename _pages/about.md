I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Children's Learning Institute](https://www.childrenslearninginstitute.org), Department of Pediatrics at the [University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston](https://www.uthouston.edu). I am currently studying brain structural connectivity in children with *traumatic brain injury (TBI)*.
